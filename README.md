# Hackmeister

## Description
Hackmeister is a search app that allows fellow developers to search for coding debugging articles on the fly. The hope is that 
people have the opportunity to find answers to any blockers or bookmark articles they may want to revisit at a later time.

## User Experience
Users are greeted with a splash screen and immediately redirected to a list of random Stack Overflow articles. Users can
search for certain topics in the input bar, which will render a new list upon typing. Tapping on the title will navigate to the
Articles tab, which is a WebView browser that will render the article page, and bookmarks toggle switches add and remove articles from the
bookmarks tab.
